In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either sertraline (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the sertraline group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p < 0.03). There was a 23% increase in T max for desmethyldiazepam in the sertraline group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p < 0.03). The clinical significance of these changes is unknown.
