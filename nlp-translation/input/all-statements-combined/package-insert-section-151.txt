Phenytoin: Phenytoin causes an approximate doubling of the clearance of Felbatol® (felbamate) at steady-state and, therefore, the addition of phenytoin causes an approximate 45% decrease in the steady-state trough concentrations of Felbatol® as compared to the same dose of Felbatol® given as monotherapy.
