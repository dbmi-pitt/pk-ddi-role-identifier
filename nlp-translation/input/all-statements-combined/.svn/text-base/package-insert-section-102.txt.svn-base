7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility can impact the absorption of other drugs.  The known drug-drug interactions are listed below.

7.1 Anticholinergic and Narcotic Analgesic Drugs

The effects of metoclopramide on gastrointestinal motility are antagonized by anticholinergic drugs and narcotic analgesics.  Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers.

7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

Metoclopramide has been shown to release catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.

7.3 Drug Absorption

Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished by metoclopramide (e.g., digoxin), whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine).

7.4 Insulin

Because the action of metoclopramide will hasten the movement of food to the intestines and therefore the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment.  Increasing movement of food to the intestines may lead to absorption of less glucose from a meal, hence less glucose in the circulation for a particular dose of administered insulin to act upon, resulting in hypoglycemia.

7.5 Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and Neuroleptics

Concomitant use of metoclopramide should be avoided in patients taking antidepressants, antipsychotics, and/or neuroleptics that have been associated with  extrapyramidal reactions such as tardive dyskinesia or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) that have occurred in association with metoclopramide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), (5.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
