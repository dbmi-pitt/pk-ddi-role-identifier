7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Nitrates

Concomitant use of REVATIO with nitrates in any form is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Ritonavir and other Potent CYP3A Inhibitors

Concomitant use of REVATIO with ritonavir and other potent CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Alpha-blockers

Use caution when co-administering alpha-blockers with REVATIO because of additive blood pressure-lowering effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

In drug-drug interaction studies, sildenafil (25 mg, 50 mg, or 100 mg) and the alpha-blocker doxazosin (4 mg or 8 mg) were administered simultaneously to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) stabilized on doxazosin therapy. In these study populations, mean additional reductions of supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 7/7 mmHg, 9/5 mmHg, and 8/4 mmHg, respectively, were observed. Mean additional reductions of standing blood pressure of 6/6 mmHg, 11/4 mmHg, and 4/5 mmHg, respectively, were also observed. There were infrequent reports of patients who experienced symptomatic postural hypotension. These reports included dizziness and light-headedness, but not syncope.

Amlodipine

When sildenafil 100 mg oral was co-administered with amlodipine, 5 mg or 10 mg oral, to hypertensive patients, the mean additional reduction on supine blood pressure was 8 mmHg systolic and 7 mmHg diastolic.
