12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Fexofenadine hydrochloride, the major active metabolite of terfenadine, is an antihistamine with selective H1-receptor antagonist activity. Both enantiomers of fexofenadine hydrochloride displayed approximately equipotent antihistaminic effects. Fexofenadine hydrochloride inhibited antigen-induced bronchospasm in sensitized guinea pigs and histamine release from peritoneal mast cells in rats. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown. In laboratory animals, no anticholinergic or alpha1-adrenergic blocking effects were observed. Moreover, no sedative or other central nervous system effects were observed. Radiolabeled tissue distribution studies in rats indicated that fexofenadine does not cross the blood-brain barrier.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Wheal and Flare

Human histamine skin wheal and flare studies in adults following single and twice daily doses of 20 mg and 40 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride demonstrated that the drug exhibits an antihistamine effect by one hour, achieves maximum effect at 2 to 3 hours, and an effect is still seen at 12 hours. There was no evidence of tolerance to these effects after 28 days of dosing. The clinical significance of these observations is unknown.

Histamine skin wheal and flare studies in 7 to 12 year old subjects showed that following a single dose of 30 mg or 60 mg, antihistamine effect was observed at one hour and reached a maximum by 3 hours. Greater than 49% inhibition of wheal area, and 74% inhibition of flare area were maintained for 8 hours following the 30 mg and 60 mg dose.

No statistically significant increase in mean QTc interval compared to placebo was observed in 714 adult subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis given fexofenadine hydrochloride capsules in doses of 60 mg to 240 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. Pediatric subjects from two placebo-controlled trials (n = 855) treated with up to 60 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride twice daily demonstrated no significant treatment- or dose-related increases in QTc. In addition, no statistically significant increase in mean QTc interval compared to placebo was observed in 40 healthy adult subjects given fexofenadine hydrochloride as an oral solution at doses up to 400 mg twice daily for 6 days, or in 230 healthy adult subjects given fexofenadine hydrochloride 240 mg once daily for one year. In subjects with chronic idiopathic urticaria, there were no clinically relevant differences for any ECG intervals, including QTc, between those treated with fexofenadine hydrochloride 180 mg once daily (n = 163) and those treated with placebo (n = 91) for 4 weeks.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine hydrochloride in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis and subjects with chronic urticaria were similar to those in healthy subjects.

Absorption

Fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets

Fexofenadine hydrochloride was absorbed following oral administration of a single dose of two 60 mg capsules to healthy male subjects with a mean time to maximum plasma concentration occurring at 2.6 hours post-dose. After administration of a single 60 mg capsule to healthy adult subjects, the mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 131 ng/mL. Following single dose oral administrations of either the 60 mg and 180 mg tablet to healthy adult male subjects, mean Cmax were 142 and 494 ng/mL, respectively. The tablet formulations are bioequivalent to the capsule when administered at equal doses. Fexofenadine hydrochloride pharmacokinetics are linear for oral doses up to a total daily dose of 240 mg (120 mg twice daily). The administration of the 60 mg capsule contents mixed with applesauce did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine in adults. Coadministration of 180 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride tablet with a high fat meal decreased the mean area under the curve (AUC) and (Cmax) of fexofenadine by 21% and 20% respectively.

Distribution

Fexofenadine hydrochloride is 60% to 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein.

Metabolism

Approximately 5% of the total dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride was eliminated by hepatic metabolism.

Elimination

The mean elimination half-life of fexofenadine was 14.4 hours following administration of 60 mg twice daily in healthy adult subjects.

Human mass balance studies documented a recovery of approximately 80% and 11% of the [14C] fexofenadine hydrochloride dose in the feces and urine, respectively. Because the absolute bioavailability of fexofenadine hydrochloride has not been established, it is unknown if the fecal component represents primarily unabsorbed drug or is the result of biliary excretion.

Special Populations

Pharmacokinetics in renally and hepatically impaired subjects and geriatric subjects, obtained after a single dose of 80 mg fexofenadine hydrochloride, were compared to those from healthy subjects in a separate study of similar design.

Renally Impaired

In subjects with mild to moderate (creatinine clearance 41 to 80 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance 11 to 40 mL/min) renal impairment, peak plasma concentrations of fexofenadine were 87% and 111% greater, respectively, and mean elimination half-lives were 59% and 72% longer, respectively, than observed in healthy subjects. Peak plasma concentrations in subjects on dialysis (creatinine clearance ≤10 mL/min) were 82% greater and half-life was 31% longer than observed in healthy subjects. Based on increases in bioavailability and half-life, a dose of 60 mg once daily is recommended as the starting dose in adult patients with decreased renal function. For pediatric patients with decreased renal function, the recommended starting dose of fexofenadine is 30 mg once daily for patients 2 to 11 years of age and 15 mg once daily for patients 6 months to less than 2 years of age.

Hepatically Impaired

The pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine hydrochloride in subjects with hepatic impairment did not differ substantially from that observed in healthy subjects.

Geriatric Subjects

In older subjects (≥65 years old), peak plasma levels of fexofenadine were 99% greater than those observed in younger subjects (<65 years old). Mean fexofenadine elimination half-lives were similar to those observed in younger subjects.

Pediatric Subjects

A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with data from 77 pediatric subjects (6 months to 12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis and 136 adult subjects. The individual apparent oral clearance estimates of fexofenadine were on average 44% and 36% lower in pediatric subjects 6 to 12 years (n = 14) and 2 to 5 years of age (n = 21), respectively, compared to adult subjects.

Administration of a 15 mg dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride to pediatric subjects 6 months to less than 2 years of age and a 30 mg dose to pediatric subjects 2 to 11 years of age produced exposures comparable to those seen with a dose of 60 mg administered to adults.

Effect of Gender

Across several trials, no clinically significant gender-related differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine hydrochloride.
