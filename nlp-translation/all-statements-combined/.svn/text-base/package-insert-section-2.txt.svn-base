12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Didanosine is an antiviral agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)].

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of didanosine in HIV-infected adult and pediatric patients are summarized in Table 7, by weight ranges that correspond to recommended doses (Table 1). Didanosine is rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations generally observed from 0.25 to 1.50 hours following oral dosing with a buffered formulation. Increases in plasma didanosine concentrations were dose proportional over the range of 50 mg to 400 mg. In adults, the mean (± standard deviation) oral bioavailability following single oral dosing with a buffered formulation is 42 (± 12)%. After oral administration, the urinary recovery of didanosine is approximately 18 (± 8)% of the dose. The CSF-plasma ratio following IV administration is 21 (± 0.03)%. Steady-state pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly from values obtained after a single dose. Binding of didanosine to plasma proteins in vitro was low (less than 5%). Based on data from in vitro and animal studies, it is presumed that the metabolism of didanosine in man occurs by the same pathways responsible for the elimination of endogenous purines.

Comparison of Didanosine Formulations

In didanosine delayed-release capsules, the active ingredient, didanosine, is protected against degradation by stomach acid by the use of an enteric coating on the beadlets in the capsule. The enteric coating dissolves when the beadlets empty into the small intestine, the site of drug absorption. With buffered formulations of didanosine, administration with antacid provides protection from degradation by stomach acid.

In healthy volunteers, as well as subjects infected with HIV-1, the AUC is equivalent for didanosine administered as the didanosine delayed-release formulation relative to a buffered tablet formulation.

The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of didanosine, administered as didanosine delayed-release, is reduced approximately 40% relative to didanosine buffered tablets. The time to the peak concentration (Tmax) increases from approximately 0.67 hours for didanosine buffered tablets to 2 hours for didanosine delayed-release capsules.

Effect of Food

In the presence of food, the Cmax and AUC for didanosine delayed-release were reduced by approximately 46% and 19%, respectively, compared to the fasting state [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Didanosine delayed-release capsules should be taken on an empty stomach.

Special Populations

Renal Insufficiency: Data from two studies using a buffered formulation of didanosine indicated that the apparent oral clearance of didanosine decreased and the terminal elimination half-life increased as creatinine clearance decreased (see Table 8). Following oral administration, didanosine was not detectable in peritoneal dialysate fluid (n = 6); recovery in hemodialysate (n = 5) ranged from 0.6% to 7.4% of the dose over a 3 to 4 hour dialysis period. The absolute bioavailability of didanosine was not affected in patients requiring dialysis [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Hepatic Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of didanosine have been studied in 12 non-HIV infected subjects with moderate (n = 8) to severe (n = 4) hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C). Mean AUC and Cmax values following a single 400 mg dose of didanosine were approximately 13% and 19% higher, respectively, in patients with hepatic impairment compared to matched healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is needed, because a similar range and distribution of AUC and Cmax values was observed for subjects with hepatic impairment and matched healthy controls [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of didanosine have been evaluated in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected pediatric patients from birth to adulthood. 

A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on pooled didanosine plasma concentration data from nine clinical trials in 106 pediatric (neonate to 18 years of age) and 45 adult patients (greater than 18 years of age). Results showed that body weight is the primary factor associated with oral clearance. Based on the data analyzed, dosing schedule (once versus twice daily) and formulation (powder for oral solution, tablet, and delayed-release capsule) did not have an effect on oral clearance. Didanosine exposure similar to that at recommended adult doses can be achieved in pediatric patients with a weight-based dosing scheme [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Geriatric Patients:  Didanosine pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Gender: The effects of gender on didanosine pharmacokinetics have not been studied.

Drug Interactions

Tables 9 and 10 summarize the effects on AUC and Cmax, with a 90% confidence interval (CI) when available, following coadministration of didanosine delayed-release with a variety of drugs. For clinical recommendations based on drug interaction studies for drugs in bold font, see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Drug Interactions (7.1).

Didanosine Buffered Formulations: Tables 11 and 12 summarize the effects on AUC and Cmax, with a 90% or 95% CI when available, following coadministration of buffered formulations of didanosine with a variety of drugs. The results of these studies may be expected to apply to didanosine delayed-release. For most of the listed drugs, no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were noted.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Didanosine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue of the naturally occurring nucleoside deoxyadenosine in which the 3’-hydroxyl group is replaced by hydrogen. Intracellularly, didanosine is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite, dideoxyadenosine 5’-triphosphate. Dideoxyadenosine 5’-triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase both by competing with the natural substrate, deoxyadenosine 5’-triphosphate, and by its incorporation into viral DNA causing termination of viral DNA chain elongation.

Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture

The anti-HIV-1 activity of didanosine was evaluated in a variety of HIV-1 infected lymphoblastic cell lines and monocyte/macrophage cell cultures. The concentration of drug necessary to inhibit viral replication by 50% (EC50) ranged from 2.5 µM to 10 µM (1 µM = 0.24 mcg/mL) in lymphoblastic cell lines and 0.01 to 0.1 µM in monocyte/macrophage cell cultures.

Resistance

HIV-1 isolates with reduced sensitivity to didanosine have been selected in cell culture and were also obtained from patients treated with didanosine. Genetic analysis of isolates from didanosine-treated patients showed mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene that resulted in the amino acid substitutions K65R, L74V, and M184V. The L74V substitution was most frequently observed in clinical isolates. Phenotypic analysis of HIV-1 isolates from 60 patients (some with prior zidovudine treatment) receiving 6 to 24 months of didanosine monotherapy showed that isolates from 10 of 60 patients exhibited an average of a 10-fold decrease in susceptibility to didanosine in cell culture compared to baseline isolates. Clinical isolates that exhibited a decrease in didanosine susceptibility harbored one or more didanosine resistance-associated substitutions.

Cross-resistance

HIV-1 isolates from 2 of 39 patients receiving combination therapy for up to 2 years with didanosine and zidovudine exhibited decreased susceptibility to didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, and zidovudine in cell culture. These isolates harbored five substitutions (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) in the reverse transcriptase gene. In data from clinical studies, the presence of thymidine analogue mutations (M41L, D67N, L210W, T215Y, K219Q) has been shown to decrease the response to didanosine.
