7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drugs or herbal products that induce enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize progestins may decrease the plasma concentrations of progestins, and may decrease the effectiveness of progestin-only pills. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of progestin-only pills include:

    * barbiturates
    * bosentan
    * carbamazepine
    * felbamate
    * griseofulvin
    * oxcarbazepine
    * phenytoin
    * rifampin
    * St. Johnâ€™s wort
    * topiramate

Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of coadministration with HIV protease inhibitors or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with progestin-only pills or the potential for enzyme alterations.
