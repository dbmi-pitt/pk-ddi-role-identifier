7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

7.1 Established Drug Interactions

Clinical recommendations based on the results of drug interaction studies are listed in Table 5. Pharmacokinetic results of drug interaction studies are shown in Tables 9 to 12 [see Contraindications (4.1 and 4.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Exposure to didanosine is increased when coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [Table 5 and see Clinical Pharmacokinetics (12.3, Tables 9 and 10)]. Increased exposure may cause or worsen didanosine-related clinical toxicities, including pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine delayed-release should be undertaken with caution, and patients should be monitored closely for didanosine-related toxicities and clinical response. Didanosine delayed-release should be suspended if signs or symptoms of pancreatitis, symptomatic hyperlactatemia, or lactic acidosis develop [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Suppression of CD4 cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with didanosine at a dose of 400 mg daily.

7.2 Predicted Drug Interactions

Predicted drug interactions with didanosine delayed-release are listed in Table 6.
