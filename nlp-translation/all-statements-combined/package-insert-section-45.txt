Phenobarbital induces many cytochrome P450 (oxidative) enzymes. When a single oral 30-mg dose of immediate-release paroxetine  was administered at phenobarbital steady state (100 mg once daily for 14 days), paroxetine AUC and TÂ½ were reduced (by an average of 25% and 38%, respectively) compared to paroxetine administered alone. The effect of paroxetine on phenobarbital pharmacokinetics was not studied. Since paroxetine exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics, the results of this study may not address the case where the 2 drugs are both being chronically dosed. No initial dosage adjustment with Paroxetine Hydrochloride Controlled-Release Tablets is considered necessary when coadministered with phenobarbital; any subsequent adjustment should be guided by clinical effect.
